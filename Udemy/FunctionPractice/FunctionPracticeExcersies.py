# Level 2 Problems

# BLACKJACK: Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum.
# If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'

# SUMMER OF '69: Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and
# extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.
