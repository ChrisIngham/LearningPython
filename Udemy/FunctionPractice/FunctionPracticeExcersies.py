# Level 2 Problems
# Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.

    newlist = []
    for i in range(len(doll)):
        newlist.append((doll[i])*3)

    return(''.join(newlist))

# BLACKJACK: Given three integers between 1 and 11, if their sum is less than or equal to 21, return their sum.
# If their sum exceeds 21 and there's an eleven, reduce the total sum by 10. Finally, if the sum (even after adjustment) exceeds 21, return 'BUST'

        total = total - 10
        return (total)
    else:
        return ("Bust")

# SUMMER OF '69: Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and
# extending to the next 9 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 9). Return 0 for no numbers.
def summer_of_69(arr):

    return(total)


# Challenging Problems
# SPY GAME: Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order
def spy_game(arr):
    if (arr.count(0) > 1) and (arr.count(7) > 0):
        if arr.index(7) > arr.index(0):
            return (True)
        else:
            return (False)
    else:
        print(False)

# COUNT PRIMES: Write a function that returns the number of prime numbers that exist up to and including a given number
def count_primes(number):
    # make a variable be the divisior and incremement it until you can divide number with it, until it equals the number value, when it hits that return false
